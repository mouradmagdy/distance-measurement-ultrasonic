# distance-measurement-ultrasonic
This project is designed to measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor interfaced with an AVR microcontroller (ATmega32) and display the measured distance on an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The microcontroller utilizes Input Capture Unit (ICU) for precise timing measurements of ultrasonic pulses.

## Features:
* Accurate distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor.
* Real-time display of measured distance on LCD.
* Utilization of AVR microcontroller's Input Capture Unit for precise timing.

## Components:
* AVR microcontroller (ATmega32)
* Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
* LCD display (16x2 character LCD)
